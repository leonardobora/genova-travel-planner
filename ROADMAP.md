# Planejador de Viagem - Genova 2025

## Roadmap & Checkpoints for Functional App (GitHub Pages Compatible)

This file documents the step-by-step plan and checkpoints for transforming this project into a fully functional, client-side travel planner. Each checkpoint should be checked off as it is completed.

---

### 1. Data Structure Design
- [x] Define and document the data structure for each section (Voos, Documentos, OrÃ§amento, Roteiro, Checklist) in localStorage.

### 2. CRUD Operations in JS
- [x] Implement add, get, update, delete, and render functions for each section in `app.js`.
- [x] Ensure all functions interact with localStorage and update the UI.

### 3. HTML Containers & Buttons
- [x] Add containers in `index.html` for dynamic lists in each section (e.g., `<div id="flights-list"></div>`).
- [x] Add edit and delete buttons for each item.
- [x] Ensure forms trigger the correct JS functions for add/edit.

### 4. Real-Time Dashboard Updates
- [x] Implement JS logic to recalculate and update dashboard stats (total budget, checklist progress, documents ready, itinerary count) in real time.

### 5. Export/Import Functionality
- [x] Add export/import buttons (e.g., in Compartilhar section).
- [x] Implement JS to export all app data as JSON and import from JSON.

### 6. Print-Friendly Itinerary
- [x] Add a print button to the Roteiro section.
- [x] Create a print stylesheet for the itinerary.

### 7. User Feedback & Validation
- [x] Implement UI feedback (toasts, modal alerts, inline validation) for all user actions and form errors.

### 8. (Optional) PWA Support
- [x] Add `manifest.json` and service worker for offline use and installability.
